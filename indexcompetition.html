                            The goal of my research was to help solve a problem that people in some countries have with getting 
                            enough energy resources, especially clean, renewable energy resources. I began to think about using a 
                            specific type of bacteria, Magnetotactic bacteria, in producing electricity. This research idea was 
                            done by professors at KDK College of Engineering in India and published in the International Journal 
                            of Engineering Research in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IJEREEE). This experiment of getting
                             an amount of electricity from these bacteria was successful and produced results, but the result was 
                             extremely few. </p> <p>
                            Consequently, I began to work on improving and enhancing the produced amount of 
                             electricity by depending on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction and making a suitable growth 
                             medium for these bacteria to increase their magnetosome number and size (diameter). For instance, 
                             Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) have magnetic ions in their composition covered by their membrane, which 
                             are called magnetosomes. Thus, these bacteria act as the flowing electrons when passing through the 
                             capillary tube, which is between the two poles of the electromagnet (solenoid), they produce an 
                             electric current due to the mechanical energy, that resulted from the movement of bacteria after 
                             being pumped into the tube and observed by the solenoid. Further, the reason for the movement of 
                             these bacteria in the capillary tube is a result of the magnetosomes that respond to the magnetic
                              field of the external magnet. </p>

                              <p>For the results section, they were more effective than the initial research done at KDK College of Engineering in India and there was a notable increase by 4 times in the produced current.
                                Also, I designed an application for aiding in calculating the resulting voltage and current via inserting the inputs of the areas of the capillary tubes, the number of loops, and the speed of the pumping speed of the bacteria.</p>

                            As modern computer technology has evolved to comprehend human brain impulses, it is
advantageous to use a computer system as a brain signal output. This technological innovation is
brain-computer interface (BCI). A brain-computer interface, also known as a brain-machine
interface or a direct neural interface, is a hardware and software communications system that
provides disabled individuals with a direct communication channel between the brain and an
external device system, as opposed to the normal output through the muscles. </p> <p>

    Experimentation has led to the development of three BCI types, namely, Invasive BCI,
    Semi-invasive BCI, and Non-invasive BCI, which differ in their implementation location of the
    brain and are used in various applications, such as gaming applications that provide these
    disabled people with amusement based on their brain signals, and medical and bioengineering
    applications. It is also used as a part of neurofeedback therapy, which helps treat psychiatric
    conditions like ADHD and anxiety. </p>

                              <p>
                                BCI games have become progressively more advanced in recent years, and have come to
include 3-D environments, multiple user objectives, and hybrid control systems combining both
conventional input devices and BCI systems. These developments have made it possible to
examine numerous paradigms throughout treatment. My study explains the implementation
of BCI in neurofeedback (NF) treatment to improve attention and other cognitive functions. The
most commonly employed NFT is based on surface EEG, as it is cost effective, practical, and
transportable. EEG-NFT involves measuring neural signals and guiding patients towards
improved neural function: patients observe a suitable graphical representation of their actual
brain activity, usually processed through a computer, and learn to self-regulate this activity in
order to bring it to a desired state. Tasks involved in NFT are repetitive and standardized. When
the task is finished, the system responds to the patient indicating they have reached the required
brainwave pattern. Several conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
anxiety, epilepsy, and addictive disorders have been treated using EEG-NFT, which shows the
ability of BCI to treat both neurological and psychological disorders.

                            STEM school is the most rigorous high school in Egypt; its curriculum is very 
                            demanding, and it requires students to complete two projects that solve one of 
                            the world's grand challenges. Entrance to this school needs a grade 9 republic 
                            rating of at least 5%, which qualifies for the school admission exam. I met the 
                            first prerequisite and was well-prepared for the admission exam in science,
                             mathematics, English, and IQ. I scored in the top one percent on the exam and
